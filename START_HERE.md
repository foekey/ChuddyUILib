## 💡 PRO TIPS

### 1. Start Simple
Don't try to read everything at once. Start with:
1. `FILE_INDEX.md`
2. `VISUAL_OVERVIEW.md`
3. Try the test script

### 2. Use Templates
`test_ultimate.lua` is a complete example. Copy it and modify for your needs!

### 3. Read As Needed
`DOCUMENTATION.md` is 50+ pages. Use it as a reference, not a novel. Search for what you need!

### 4. Test Thoroughly
Before sharing your hub:
- Test all features
- Try different executors
- Test in multiple games
- Get feedback

### 5. Ask Questions
- Check DOCUMENTATION.md first
- Then check SETUP.md
- Still stuck? Open GitHub issue
- Community is here to help!

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### File Naming When Uploading
```
ChuddyUILib_Ultimate.lua → source.lua  (simpler URL)
test_ultimate.lua → test.lua  (optional)
All .md files → keep names as-is
```

### In Your URLs
Replace these placeholders:
- `YOUR_USERNAME` → Your GitHub username
- `YOUR_URL` → Your raw GitHub URL
- `REPO_NAME` → Your repository name

### Before Sharing
- Test in executor first
- Make sure all features work
- Check URLs are correct
- Read through docs once
